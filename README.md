# Wolf Cafe

## Project Description
For a class, as a group, we had to create a GrubHub knock-off called Wolf Cafe. We had to decide the designs of both the backend and frontend of this project.  
The system has the possibility to log in as three different users: admin, staff, or customer. Then each user has different permissions for the things they are allowed to do. An admin is allowed to create staff members and edit staff or customer accounts. Staff members can update the inventory, add new ingredients to the inventory, create new products to sell, fulfill orders, manage the status of orders, and see the order history. Customers are allowed to browse the catalog of products, add products to their cart, checkout their items, and track their orders. 

## My Contributions
I was in charge of part of the frontend. I had to design and implement the login, customer registration, staff dashboard, checkout, and active orders pages. 

## Credits
My team members were Cooper Sizemore, Mikhail Alperovich, Aishwarya Radhakrishnan, Suhani Gulati, and Jason Yin. They implemented parts of the frontend and backend.

## Technologies used
- Java
- IntelliJ
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- VSCode
- PostMan
- MySQL

## Challenges
- Figuring out all of the necessary requirements after reading the project description. It was hard to organize that information.   
- Distinguishing what products, items, and recipes are.
- Organizing efficient time management in the group to finish all tasks on time (especially when some people's tasks relied on the completion of other people's tasks).

## Accomplishments
- Learned to work with PostMan and MySQL
- Improved my frontend coding skills
- Developed more design skills
- Worked in a large team all with different roles
